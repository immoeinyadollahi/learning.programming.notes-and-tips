Laravel includes built-in authentication and session services which are typically accessed via the Auth and Session facades. These features provide cookie-based authentication for requests that are initiated from web browsers.

you can interact with these authentication services manually to build your application's own authentication layer. 
However, to help you get started more quickly, we have free packages (starter kits) that provide robust, modern scaffolding of the entire authentication layer
they just template built on top of built-in browser authentication services
