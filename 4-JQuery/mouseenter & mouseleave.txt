instead of these two events jquery use mouseout & mouseover because delegation can't work with these events
jquery use their bubbling ability internally only for delegation and you cant use it for either bubbling or to-child & from-child counting (its like regular mouseenter/mouseleave for you)
with `!related (for leave/enter the window) || ( related !== currentTarget && !jQuery.contains( currentTarget, related ) )`  jquery prevent  to-child & from-child counting also bubbling like regular mouseout or mouseover behaviour

these events will be fixed with there value but only for delegation and not become same as there fixed
mouseenter: "mouseover",
mouseleave: "mouseout",
pointerenter: "pointerover",
pointerleave: "pointerout"
