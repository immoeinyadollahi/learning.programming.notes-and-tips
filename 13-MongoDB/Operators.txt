same operators in different areas acts differently
like push in update and aggregation

there are also different areas in aggregate that have there own conditions for operators


areas:

Query and Projection Operators (query means regular queries)

Query operators provide ways to locate or find data within the database
Projection operators modify how data is presented.


Update Operators

Update operators are operators that enable you to modify the data in your database or add additional data.
two types of update operators are:
1-fields
2-arrays --->> consists of operators and modifiers



Aggregation Pipeline Stages

each stage has different name.for example we have sort stage or match stage.they will be written like operators with starting $ but they are stage identifier
we have only one stage identifier in each stage in each pipeline that located in stage top level
this are like statements in javascript opposite to expressions


Aggregation Pipeline Expression Operators

this operators are expressions.means returns or resolves to single value



two main topics in all areas

1-query expressions alongside with query operators that are special expressions that resolve to binary boolean to indicate the result of there match

regular query,aggregation match stage,some parts of update operations and projection


2-aggregate expressions alongside with expression operators that resolve to single value
aggregation pipeline expression operators,$expr operator in regular query environemnt


3-accumulator expressions alongside with accumulator operators that return accumulated result
$group stage
