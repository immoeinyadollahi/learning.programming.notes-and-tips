this stage for each item in input documents evaluate the _id field then push it to array,then those with same _id (that evaluted to single value,if object or array then compares only values,orders,quantity of them)
will become one single group(unqiue items will be separate group as well),then for each group first add evaluated _id field to them, then evaluate each new fields(that use accumlators) with context of items of group,finally add new fields

if input documents are empty, group doesn't do anything
