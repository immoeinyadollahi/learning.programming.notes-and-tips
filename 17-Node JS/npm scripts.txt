when using packages command like tools in npm scripts node first look through bin folder in local node_modules and if it exist, execute that, but if nout found it will look through global modules

but if we want to execute modules cli tool directly, we should execute them manually in command line with write in command line :`node_modules/bin/xxxx.sh`
