ways to set env variables:
1. system default env variable (predefined variable)
2. variables that set from terminal when stating server (name=value style) (only bash-like terminals and not windows cmd)
3. using .env file and then in app use third party library to parse that file and include them in env object or array 


in step 2 we can use cross-env lib for using in windows cmd because that doesn't support this style
