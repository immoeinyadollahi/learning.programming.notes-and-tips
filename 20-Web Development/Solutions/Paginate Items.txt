first do query (only one query) and get all items without limit and skip and only ordering
then get paginated items and limit them
then populate extra info for each items

sequelize:  use lazy loading after query and after limiting items and not eager loading

mongodb: like sequelize use populate after limiting with populate method for each individual document
