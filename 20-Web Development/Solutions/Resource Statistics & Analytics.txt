we have static and dynamic analytics and statistics

statistics:
			  if statistics are huge and requires lots of db requests
					single field statistics : store statistics fields in resource and update it whenever any dependecy changes (e.g. user rating that must be updated after inserting new review that related to user)
																									
			  or whether statistics need lots of db requests or not :
					  just request to db whatever needed dynamicaly
						
						
						
analytics:
				because analytics need timestamp and other analytics related data, they cann't be stored statically and must be dynamic
				to improve db requests we can store related date in separate table or in simplied table with all columns needed and dynamicaly read it from db whenever needed
