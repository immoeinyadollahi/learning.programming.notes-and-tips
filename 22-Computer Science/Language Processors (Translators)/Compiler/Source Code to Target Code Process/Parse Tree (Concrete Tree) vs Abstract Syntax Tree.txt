Simply, AST only contains semantics of the code, Parse tree/CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) also includes information on how exactly code was written. 
The concrete syntax tree contains all information like superfluous parenthesis and whitespace and comments, 
the abstract syntax tree abstracts away from this information.
