Computers CPU only understand binary (0 or 1),so assembly language or high level languages must be translated to binary or machine code (by compiler or interpreter or assembler)

these three translators have different names because they have different translation process
e.g. compilers and assemblers translate at once and produce executable file whereas interpreters translate dynamicaly (could be line by line)
