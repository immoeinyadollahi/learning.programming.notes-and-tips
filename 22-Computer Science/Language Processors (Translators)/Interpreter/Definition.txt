an interpreter is a computer program (langauge translator) that directly executes (translate to target code) instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. 
An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

1. Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly in machine;
2. Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and then immediately execute that;
3. Explicitly execute stored precompiled bytecode made by a compiler and matched with the interpreter Virtual Machine.
