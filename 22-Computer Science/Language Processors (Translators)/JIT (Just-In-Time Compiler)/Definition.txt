A JIT compiler only looks at the bytecode once (intermediate language code), and compiles it to native code which can then be understood directly by the computer - no further translation required. The translation takes time, so if you can do it just the once, it's more efficient.
it is something between interpreter and compiler (close to compiler) that compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime and use cache to improve performance
