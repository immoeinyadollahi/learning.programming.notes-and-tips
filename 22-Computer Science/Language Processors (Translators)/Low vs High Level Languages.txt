low level languages are machine code and assembly language (close to machine langauge or machine-friendly)

other languages treated as high level language (close to human language or human-friendly)

assembly is low level language but it also must be translate to machine code

high level languages must be compiled or interpreted and language like assembly must be assembled (by assembler)

						In the old days, C was considered a high-level language. Today, many engineers might laugh at that because C is so low level. C and C++ are now considered low-level languages because they have no automatic memory management. 
						The only true low level programming is machine code or assembly
