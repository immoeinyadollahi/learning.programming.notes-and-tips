Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values  from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers) . 
Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference
type coercion is implicit and type conversion can be either implicit or explicit (or just explicit) and type casting it explicit
