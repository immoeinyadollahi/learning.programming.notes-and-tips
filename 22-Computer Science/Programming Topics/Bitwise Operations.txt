1. a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits

2. manipulates or operates the individual bits in bit string (A bit-string is a sequence of binary digits (bits))


Bitwise operators are characters that represent actions to be performed on single bits (operates on single bit)
in result,resolve to numbers generated by bits


	Left Shift Operator
	think we have a bit string of (00000000000001) and use 1 <<  1 to create 00010 to produce integer 2
	using 1 << 2 means shift number 1 (formated in bits) by 2
	right operand is how many should shift (don't convert it to binary,its simple number)
	left operand should converted to binrary format then apply shift
