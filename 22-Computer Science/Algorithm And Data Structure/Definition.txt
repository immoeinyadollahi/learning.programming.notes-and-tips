Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem

A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system.Think of sequences of numbers,array,stack, or tables of data.these are both well-defined data structures

An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output.
An algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem

Data stylryctures are for holding data
Data means every things like pointer,callbacks or primitives and ....
