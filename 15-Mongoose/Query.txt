mongoose query methods however is same as mongodb methods but are different (manipulated or controlled by mongoose) in some cases:

	find:
		if we have <array-field>:<array-value> in mongoose it convert this to $in operator,but in mongodb it check for equality (deep not shallow)
		of field with that array and not array contains the field

	update:

		in mongodb all update operations requires atomic (update specific) operators but in mongoose <field>:<new-value> is equivalent to $set:{<field>:<new-value>}
		
		
mongoose also manipulate aggregate method but objectId must be mongodb objectId
