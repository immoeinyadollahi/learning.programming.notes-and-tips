Type declarations can be added to function arguments, return values, and, as of PHP 7.4.0, class properties
type declaration differs from type casting

function arguments, return values only happens at function call
but class properties happens both and declaration and property modification
there is some exceptions like if property type is string we can set value to int or bool but if type is int we can't set string value; (value will be cast to property type if have different type if there is no error)
if type mismatch TypeError will be thrown
