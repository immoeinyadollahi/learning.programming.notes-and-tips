delimter can be any character except alphanumeric (number and alphabetic character) or backslash characters

delimiters must be the same

if you want to use delimiter character as literal character inside of regex you should escape it otherwise throw error
but if you use characters that aren't delimiter, its valid
for sure use if you don't know pattern exactly or using variable, use @ or ~ because they are less likely exists in pattern itself
