variables are (containers or dishes):

1-simple scope variable (stack variable)
2-arrays property
3-object property

tips:

variables that passed by reference:

only in loops if there is such a variable name in scopes, that will be redeclared and gets new reference


variables that passed by value:

if there is such a variable name in scopes, that will be set to new value.(not redeclare)
also if that is a reference variable ,whole reference will change (side effect)

ways we can pass variables by reference:

foreach                       (cause redeclaration if variable currently exists)
function parameter
function `use`
function return
assignment



assignment to reference variable means setting reference value
