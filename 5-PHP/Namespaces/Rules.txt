1. in files that have namespace if we want to use another namespace class and without using `use` keyword we should prepend class fully qualified name with `\` otherwise class name will be appended to current file namespace and throw non existance exception (for `use` keyword its optional anywhere)

2.classes in same namespace (in another file or same file) can be used directly in that namespace files without fully qualified name or alias
