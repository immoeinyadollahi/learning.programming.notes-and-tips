in array setting property or setting property of length index:

if the reference before no exists at all:

	if reference is variable:

		create that variable for target scope
		then set its value to an empty array
		then set property of that array 

	if reference is property of array or object:
		
		first change its value to an empty array
		then set property of that array
	

if the reference before exists but is null (can be variable or property):

	first change its value to an empty array
	then set property of that array




only setting array property has these features and objects throw fatal error if you do these actions
