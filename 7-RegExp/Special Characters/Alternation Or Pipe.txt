The alternation operator has the lowest precedence of all regex operators.
That is, it tells the regex engine to match either everything to the left of the vertical bar, or everything to the right of the vertical bar. 
If you want to limit the reach of the alternation, you need to use parentheses for grouping. 

or 

alternation operator has unlimited radius, to limit its radius use grouping (all valid grouping token,even non-captuing ones)




the regex engine will study the entire regular expression before starting. 
So it knows that this regular expression uses alternation, 
and that the entire regex has not failed yet.
