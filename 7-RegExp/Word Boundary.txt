A word boundary can occur in one of three positions:

1-Before the first character in the string, if the first character is a word character.
2-After the last character in the string, if the last character is a word character.
3-Between two characters in the string, where one is a word character and the other is not a word character.

it is equivalent to  /^(?=\w)|(?<=\w)$|(?<=\w)(?=\W)|(?<=\W)(?=\w)/
