innertText returns rendered or human readable (not hidden) texts of element (concated texts inside of element)
textContent returns all text inside of element


if element itself is not rendered (not in dom tree or hidden from view (only display:none)),then these two properties are the same even if all of there children are hidden or not in tree

hidden means only display:none not visibility or opacity

set method for both works similarly
