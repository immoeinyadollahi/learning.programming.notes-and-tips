when creating event object from constructor,bubbles property with false value doesn't mean all bubbling handlers don't execute, only e.target bubbling handlers will be called and event doesn't propagate upward to other elements 

there is no difference between script generated events and browser generated events, browser only set values to event object properties, also built-in events and custom event are the same, they are just object

el.dispatchEvent(e) return value indicates continue or not

properties:

isTrusted :

				means event generated by browser or developer script, that is
				default is false, means script generated event, but browser in creation of event set that to true, means generated from browser


e.preventDefault():

in order to preventing the default action works, event must be cancelable (el.dispatchEvent(e) always returns true if event isn't cancelable)

two ways to prevent event default action:

1. The main way is to use the event object. Thereâ€™s a method event.preventDefault().
2. If the handler is assigned using on<event> (not by addEventListener), then returning false also works the same.


events alone don't have default actions, but browser by dispatching some events on some elements does some default actions
