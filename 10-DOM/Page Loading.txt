DOMContentLoaded:

1. scripts that don't block this event are async scripts and dynamically added * external (with src) * scripts (whether or not its async or defer or none of those)


load:

1. waits for all styles and images and other resources (iframe,video,audio,...), also always happens after domcontentloaded event (whether or not there is style or other resource element in page)



beforeunload:

1. there is no way to customize message from preventing this event in modern browsers
2. to prevent this event with alert:

														in onbeforeunload dom method we can return any value (not only false but any value) except undefind to prevent this
														in addEventListener,e.preventDefault not working here,but set value to e.returnValue shows related alert (any value,just set value)
														
														
document.readyState

current loading state of document

loading means document is loading (default state on page loading)
interactive means DOMContentLoaded event
complete means load event

readyState will be changed before its related event then right after that such event will be fired (first readyState changes then its event will be fired)

e.g document.readyState becomes interactive right before DOMContentLoaded. These two things actually mean the same (means document loaded).happens at about the same time as DOMContentLoaded, but before it.

we can use readystatechange event when state changed instead of load and DOMContentLoaded events
