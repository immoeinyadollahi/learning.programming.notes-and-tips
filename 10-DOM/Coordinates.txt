coordinates of an element is coordinates of minimal rectangle that encloses element


pageY,pageX – document-relative(based) coordinate ,offset from top or left of document (similar to position:absolute relative to document but not completely the same)

clientY,clientX – window-relative(based) (viewport) coordinate ,offset from top or left of window or viewport (similar to position:fixed but not completely the same)


methods:

element.getBoundingClientRect():   get information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport .  returns window-relative coordinates for a minimal rectangle that encloses elem ,relative to top or left edge of viewport or window
tip: coordinates may be negative as well


window.elementFromPoint(x, y):   returns the most nested element at window coordinates (x, y)


tips:

Javascript Coordinates right/bottom are different from CSS position properties

in CSS positioning, right property means the distance from the right edge, and bottom property means the distance from the bottom edge.

in JavaScript All window-relative or document-relative coordinates are counted from the top or left corner, including right and bottom rect coords.




tips:

for any element not just mouse position
getting document-relative coordinates of element not window-relative(getBoundingClientRect)
pageY = clientY + documentElement or body scrollTop
pageX = clientX + documentElement or body scrollLeft




Summary

Any point on the page has coordinates:

Relative to the window – elem.getBoundingClientRect().
Relative to the document – elem.getBoundingClientRect() plus the current page scroll.
