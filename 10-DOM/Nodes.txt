we have 12 node types at all:   https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node

we have four main types of nodes (in practice)

1. document node                      the “entry point” into DOM
2. element node                         HTML-tags, the tree building blocks
3. text node                                 contain text (without children)
4. comment node                       sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM





document node:




comment node:
It doesn’t affect the visual representation in any way. But there’s a rule – if something’s in HTML, then it also must be in the DOM tree.







tips:


dom element finding/selection methods are only for element nodes & document node

getElementById	& getElementsByName is only for document object not every element

we cann't select text or comment node,therefore we cann't access methods like querySelector

first element node  of document is root element (documentElement or html)

there is no constructor for creating text and comment node.you should use document to create them
