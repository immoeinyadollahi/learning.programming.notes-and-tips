In HTML, tags may have attributes. When the browser parses the HTML to create DOM objects for tags, it recognizes standard attributes and creates DOM properties from them.

So when an element has id or another standard attribute, the corresponding property gets created. But that doesn’t happen if the attribute is non-standard.

Please note that a standard attribute for one element can be unknown for another one. For instance, "type" is standard for <input>, but not for <body>.
and because of that no dom property will be ceated for that attribute
however we can add any new property or methods manualy to dom object for specific element

Attributes – is what’s written in HTML.
Properties – is what’s in DOM objects.


1. attributes are for html

Their name is case-insensitive (id is same as ID).
Their values are always strings.


2. properties are for dom

They are case-sensitive (because they are regular object properties)
They can have any value with different data types.


property-attribute synchronization
When a standard attribute changes, the corresponding property in dom is auto-updated, and vice versa with some exceptions .
