Geometry properties are zero/null for elements that are not displayed (display:none) or not in tree (document) . also scroll methods doesn't work and scroll properties are zero or null. also Coordinates are zero or null

Geometry properties are calculated only for displayed elements.

If an element (or any of its ancestors) has display:none or is not in the document, then all geometry properties are zero (or null for offsetParent).
or
if an element has display:none or is not in the document, then all geometry properties are zero (or null for offsetParent) for that element as well as all of its decendants.

For example, offsetParent is null, and offsetWidth, offsetHeight are 0 when we created an element, but haven’t inserted it into the document yet, or it (or it’s ancestor) has display:none.
