there are two types of stop propagation:

1-event itself does not propagate like mouseenter that does not bubble upward

2-manual stopping propagation by user


tips:

Note that while formally there are 3 phases (capturing target bubbling), the 2nd phase (“target phase”: the event reached the element) is not handled separately: handlers on both capturing and bubbling phases trigger at that phase.
so while formally there are 3 phases but we only have two phase at all
