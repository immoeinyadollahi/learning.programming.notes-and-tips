sorting layer has precedence over order in layer
if a sorting layer is placed lower than other sorting layers,then it have more precedence for rendering
and if sorting layers are equal,then order in layer will be applied
more order in layer is, more precedence sprite have for rendering

bottom sorting layers rendered on top of other sorting layers
or simply say if index of sorting layer is bigger than other layers, it will be rendered on top of other layers

if sorting layer is higher than others but order in layer is bigger,because they are in differnt sorting layer,higher sorting layer will be placed behind of lower layers
but if sorting layer is the same,order in layer indicates which one has more precedence

** order in layer is only for when sorting layer is the same

** order in layer is for sorting in same sorting layers

**** Assumption ****
if both are equal (sorting layer and order in layer), component creation time (new instance created) will indicate which one should have precedence over another 



** higher means lower index and lower means higher index
