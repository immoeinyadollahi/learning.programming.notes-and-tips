in unity we only set layers on game objects but that layer will be used in different places
layer property on game object is simple integer which represent layer index in layers list not layermask
we use layermask to include or exclude specifc layer by its index in each bit

You can only assign each GameObject to one layer, but you can add multiple GameObjects to one layer. (one to many relationship)
means at anytime game object can only have one layer
however we can switch between layers at any time


Layers in Physics

				Tips
				in physics, we don't attach game object layer to bodies,instead layers (filter) attach to each collider (shape or fixure)
				so in unity the layers attached to every game object will added to every collider it has as filter data (in physics engine)
				i dont know maybe unity add layer to each body and when checking for collisions,instead of getting layer from collider,we get from collider body custom attached data
				
				Layers for queries
				for queries like casts and overlaps we pass layermask to methods
				
				Layers for collision detection in simulation time
				for simulation collision detection we specify collision matrix in settings
				
				for simulation collision detection,we only use layers and not layermasks but in query we use layermasks because we need to inlcude (hit) or exclude (ignore) layers against hit but in collision detection because collison only happens on two collider,we only need to know each collider layer and check for their matrix in order to perform proper action

				
Layer Masks Constants
Physics.DefaultRaycastLayers is equal to -5 which represent 1111111111111011 bitmask that includes all layers and excludes ignore raycast built in layer
Physics.AllLayers is equal to -1 which include all layers
Physics.IgnoreRaycastLayer is equal to 4 which only includes ignore raycast layer (00000000000000100)

for physics these layermasks are not only for raycast but are for all query methods like overlap and other casts
also these layermasks are not only for physics queries,but can be used in different places like camera culling mask
