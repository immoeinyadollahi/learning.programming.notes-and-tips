1. Layer-based camera rendering
														Using the Camera culling mask with layers, we can render only the objects in a particular layer, or selection of layers
														culling mask means layer based rendering of game object
														
														
														
2. Layer-based Physics collision detection and query

														Query
																	we use layermask and layer in query to include (select or hit) or exclude (ignore) collider within query based on their layers (filter which collider to select or hit)
																	
														Collision Detection
																	we use layers collision matrix to determine which colliders should collide with other colliders based on their layers
																	we can specify which colliders should not collide with other colliders (pass through)
																	e.g. in default matrix configuration we specified that every collider with all layers can collide with other colliders
