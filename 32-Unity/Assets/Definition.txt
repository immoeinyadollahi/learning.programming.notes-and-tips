for every file imported into project (from editor or filesystem) new object will be created
object can be Object instance directly or subclasses of Object (Texture2D,Sprite,...) based on file format

assets are objects outside of any scene (not every objects outside of scene are asset)
in scene only game objects with their components can be placed
e.g. prefabs are assets which don't exist in any scene
