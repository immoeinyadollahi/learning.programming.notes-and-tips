In real life, sounds are emitted by objects (sources) and heard by listeners (can be microphone or human ears)
The way a sound is perceived depends on a number of factors (position or distance of source relative to listener,surrounding ambient,velocity of source may change pitch what received by listeners)


To simulate the effects of position, Unity requires sounds to originate from Audio Sources attached to objects which have transform (for caluclating position we need game object transform to achieve that)
