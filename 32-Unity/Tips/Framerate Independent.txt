for doing actions but independent of framerate:

1. for physics stuff (force,...) we should use FixedUpdate
										When applying for example movement calculations inside FixedUpdate, you do not need to multiply your values by Time.deltaTime. This is because FixedUpdate is called on a reliable timer, independent of the frame rate.



2. for changing properties like transform we should use Time.deltaTime (multiply transform by Time.deltaTime) to modify values independent of framerate
