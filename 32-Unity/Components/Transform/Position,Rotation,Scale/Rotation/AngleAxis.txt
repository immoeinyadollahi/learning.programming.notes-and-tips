Creates a rotation which rotates angle degrees around axis. (vector (axis) magnitude will be ignored and not applied and treat vector as direction)
simply put, rotates around the given axis by the number of degrees defined by the given angle.


Conversion
we have toAngleAxis method in quaternion to convert quaternion to angle axis (angle,axis), in inverse we have AngleAxis method for Quaternion class which convert angle,axis to quaternion
