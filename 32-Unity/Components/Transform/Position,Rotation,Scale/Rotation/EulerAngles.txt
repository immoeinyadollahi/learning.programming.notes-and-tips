euler angles will be used for euler angle represention of the rotation which is based on vector3
euler angles will be used to represent 3 components (x,y,z) of quaternions by applying each component around their individual axes
euler angles can represent a three dimensional rotation by performing three separate rotations around individual axes. In Unity these rotations are performed around the Z axis, the X axis, and the Y axis, in that order.

eularAngles vector components values indicate rotation angle around that axis

** Unity performs the Euler rotations sequentially around the z-axis, the x-axis and then the y-axis


*** each XYZ values represent angle degrees which must be applied on individual axes


Conversion
we have eulerangles property for quaternion to convert quaternion to vector,and in inverse we have Eular static method for Quaternion class which convert xyz components to quaternion


************************ Important Assumption **********************
like Input.mousePosition which is simple vector but its units represent pixels  (relative to screen space)
eularAngles vector compoents indicate angle around that axis 


euler angles doesn't have to be vector, only XYZ values will be used not magniatude or direction of vector, euler angles just rotate around each X Y Z axis by given each component values
so vector will not be used like other places, its like Input.mousePosition which vector just holds mouse position in pixel or sprite renderer size which is vector but it just holds x y values 
vector is not used like physics nad positions

so assume that eularAngles uses vector only for holding XYZ values


Tips
1. eularAngles are always positive and in range of 0,360 degrees
   if you set eularAngles to negative or more than 360 degrees, it will be corrected
