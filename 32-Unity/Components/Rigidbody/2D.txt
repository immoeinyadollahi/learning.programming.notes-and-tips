Static Type
There are two ways to mark a Rigidbody 2D as Static (two ways to make a game object a static body in physics engine):

1. For the GameObject without a Rigidbody 2D component at all. (only way in 3D)

2. For the GameObject that have a Rigidbody 2D and its body type set to Static.

Method 1 is a shorthand for making Static Collider 2Ds. When creating large numbers of Static Collider 2Ds, it is easier not to have to add a Rigidbody 2D for each GameObject with a Collider 2D.

Method 2 exists for performance reasons. If a Static Collider 2D needs to be moved or reconfigured at run time, it is faster to do so when it has its own Rigidbody 2D. If a group of 0



***** if we attach a rigidbody with type of static or don't attach at all,for each game object a static body will be created in physics world
      they only key point is with rigidbody compoent, we have access to physics engine body reference (not directly) as api and can manipulate its properties
      but without rigidbody component we don't
      so only difference is reference to physics engine body or accessing api





Kinematic Type
rigidbody 2D component has both isKinematic proeprty and type of Kinematic
both work the same
when setting isKinematic to true,type will be Kinematic for body
isKinematic for rigidbody 2d is just for convenience between 3d and 2d
