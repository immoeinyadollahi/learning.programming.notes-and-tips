rigidbody allows game objects to be affected by physics
control of an object's properties like transform through physics simulation. (Unity)
gameobject will be under control of physics (transform of gameobject will be updated by physics)

technically means game objects with this component will be known to physics engine world as dynamic body with shape and colliders and various properties like mass,... 
and when removing this component from game objects,body will become static in physics world
is kinematic property turn dynamic body to kinematic body in box2d and set dynamic body flag to kinematic in physx



so game object without rigidibody will be static body in physics world
and when adding rigidbody to gameobject,body in physics world will be changed to dynamic body





*** Rigidbody component is just an api to working with corresponding physic engine body of game object
