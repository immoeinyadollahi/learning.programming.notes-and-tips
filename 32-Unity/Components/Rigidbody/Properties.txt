in both 2d and 3d, rigidbody position and rotation properties, refers position and rotation of body in physics engine world
that will be synced with game object transform

** If you change the position or rotation of a Rigibody using Rigidbody.position or rotation or MovePosition or MoveRotation,  (i don't know if changes applied immediately in physics engine)
   the transform of corresponding game object will be updated after the next physics simulation step (in WriteTransform phase)
