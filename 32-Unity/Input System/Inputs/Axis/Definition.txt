Virtual Axis
one virtual axis which contain values between -1,1

differs from coordinates axes, its just simple one direction axis,\
a thing with range of -1,1


The value will be in the range of -1...1 for keyboard and joystick input devices.


Devices
The meaning of this value depends on the type of input control

If the axis is mapped to joystick's horizontal axis a value of 1 means the stick is pushed all the way to the right and a value of -1 means it's all the way to the left; a value of 0 means the joystick is in its neutral position.

If the axis is mapped to mouse, the value is different and may not be in the range of -1...1. Instead it'll be the current mouse position delta multiplied by the axis sensitivity. Typically a positive value means the mouse is moving right/up and a negative value means the mouse is moving left/down.




GetAxis
Returns the value of the virtual axis identified by axisName with smoothing filtering applied.

***** this is frame rate independednt means doesn't need to multiplied by Time.deltaTime


GetAxisRaw
Returns the value of the virtual axis identified by axisName with no smoothing filtering applied.

Since input is not smoothed, keyboard input will always be either -1, 0 or 1
and is useful if you want to do all smoothing processing yourself.

*** this method can be used frame-independently in fixed update





GetAxis vs GetAxisRaw (keyboard)

1. GetAxis is between -1,1 and can be 0 but never get exactly -1,1
   GetAxisRaw is always -1, 0 or 1


2. GetAxis is good for joystick because value can be between 1 and -1 or 0 besed on stick position
   GetAxisRaw doesn't care about joysticks exact position, if its in up direction,return 1 ,if doesn't move return 0, if its in down direction return -1


3. GetAxis Horizontal and Vertical ranges change from 0 to +1 or -1 with increase/decrease in 0.05f steps. 
   GetAxisRaw has changes from 0 to 1 or -1 immediately, so with no steps.

GetAxis is good for joystick movement (variable)
GetAxisRaw is good for constant movement




************ Important *************
GetAxis and GetAxisRaw are equal for axes like MouseX,MouseY,MouseScrollWheel and are frame-independednt
