Input.mouseScrollDelta returns delta (variation or change) of previous frame scroll position to current frame (inputs get updated in start of every frame)

mouseScrollDelta is delta for scroll position in Vector unit which its y axis is scroll delta value and its value is always Multiplication of 1 (1,2,3,4,5,-1,-2,...)

*** mouseScrollDelta vector.x will be ignored and always is 0, it was better to return a float value instead of vector2 because only y axis value will be used


** positive means scroll up and negative means scroll down


Unity
Input.mouseScrollDelta is stored in a Vector2.y property. (The Vector2.x value is ignored.) 
Input.mouseScrollDelta can be positive (up) or negative (down). The value is zero when the mouse scroll is not rotated. (between two frames) 
The value returned by mouseScrollDelta will need to be adjusted according to the scroll rate (sensitivity)



Difference between mouseScrollDelta and GetAxis("Mouse ScrollWheel")

mouseScrollDelta (y property) is always Multiplication of 1 while GetAxis is delta between -1,1 as floating point number which is always Multiplication of 0.1 (0.1,0.2,0.3,-0.1,...)
