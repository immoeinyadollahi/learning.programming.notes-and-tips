Composition
compose reuseable parts (components)	


example -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/891820/14719082

e.g. laravel blade supports inheritance and also includes(composition of reuseable parts)

** composition in general can be implemented anywhere that uses component concept (reuseable parts)


in unity, we can use composition and inheritance for components

1. components inheritance

2. separate components for specific behaviours
