*** frame-independent doesn't always mean per second,it will be per fixed physic time step in FixedUpdate 
    here we only use per second for conversion but frame independent can be any units independent of frame


concept is converting units from `per frame` to `per second`

e.g. for moving object for exact 1 unit, instead of moving object by 1 unit in each frame (per frame), we should move object by 1 unit in 1 second (per second)

** unit can be any value

so only concept is unit conversion just like speed,acceleration,mass,...
just like mass kilogram unit which can be converted to gram by 1/1000 proportion
for converting per frame to per second we use 1/framerate proportaion which is same as Time.deltaTime

e.g. deltaTime value in 10 fps game can be calculated by (1*1) / 10 = 0.1 -> deltaTime
     and for converting 1 unit per frame into per second we should just multiply it by deltaTime which produces per second value

** multiplying unit by Time.deltaTime is same as devide unit by framerate
