a way of packing images together as one image, which is then used to create animations and sprite graphics as it will use low memory and increase the performance of games

it uses low memory because instead of loading multiple images into memory,just slice multiple sprites from one image and create sprite from each of them

collection of images in one image called sprite sheet
for tile based sprites called tileset
