Unity may use children or parent in som places which may not refer to only direct children or parent
they may refer to all decendants or ancestors

e.g. GetComponentInParent refer to component in all ancestors not just direct parent or transform.Find refer to all decendants not just direct children

generaly children are direct decendants and parent is direct ancestor but unity may use them as all decendants or ancestors
