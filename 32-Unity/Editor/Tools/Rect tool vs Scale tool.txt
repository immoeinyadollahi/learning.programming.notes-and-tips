Scale tool is only for scaling which scales from origin of transform that make sprite/mesh stretch from both sides

Rect tool use both scale and position which scales transform while moves origin position which makes an illusion that game object is scaling from one side only
it will reposition game object when scaling which pretend game object is scaling only from specific sides

technically scale will move veritces from all sides
