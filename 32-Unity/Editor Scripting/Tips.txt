any changes to assets,game object,configurations in scripts which run in editor is same as modifying in editor manually
they don't get saved automatically just like when you do in editor but if you save the project manually in editor,those changes will be saved
because manually modifying in editor and by scripts are same things


e.g. prefab modifications in scripts work just like when you do it in editor
