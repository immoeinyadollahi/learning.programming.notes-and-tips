DontDestroyOnLoad is a scene same as other scenes but is not asset and has different behaviours
we can move game objects from DontDestroyOnLoad scene to other scenes or interact with scene object

think of this scene as an dynamic scene and not static asset like other scenes

*** loading new scenes even in Single mode don't unload DontDestroyOnLoad scene
*** DontDestroyOnLoad can't be unloaded with unload scene method on scene manager
*** this scene gets removed when its game objects cleared
