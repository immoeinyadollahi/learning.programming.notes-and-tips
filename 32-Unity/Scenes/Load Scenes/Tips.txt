1. unity doesn't say don't do anything after calling LoadScene method or LoadSceneAsync setting allowSceneActivation set to true,for example say all scene references get lost after calling these methods
   this will not happen and all actions performed after current frame get finished completely,even after OnDestroy and OnDisable messages at end of frame
   so this ensure that none of our scripts run when activating new scene

2. loading new scene doesn't reset things like Time.timeScale,... or other configurations
