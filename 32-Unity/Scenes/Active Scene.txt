The active Scene is the Scene which will be used as the target for new GameObjects instantiated by scripts and from what Scene the lighting settings are used.
When you add a Scene additively (see LoadSceneMode.Additive), the first Scene is still kept as the active Scene. 
Use this to switch the active Scene to the Scene you want as the target.

There must always be one Scene marked as the active Scene. Note the active Scene has no impact on what Scenes are rendered.
