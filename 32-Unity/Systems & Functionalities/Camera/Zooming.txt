for both FOV (prespective projection) and orthographicSize (orthographic projection) smaller value means zoom in and bigger value means zoom out

we use scroll up to zoom in and scroll down to zoom out

for camera zoom we say targetZoom -= Input.mouseScrolLDelta
because its reverse in most cases,when scroll goes up,camera FOV or orthographic must be decreased and when scroll goes down,they must be increased (zoom in and out)

if we want to zoom inverse we should use targetZoom += Input.mouseScrolLDelta



Smooth Zoom
key point is, we specify a target zoom, and we should reach that target zoom smoothly over time and frame by frame not immediately
so we store a target zoom outside of Update method because we should get same value between frames

*** when scrolling in order to zoom in/out, target zoom will be determined immediately not overtime and frame by frame
