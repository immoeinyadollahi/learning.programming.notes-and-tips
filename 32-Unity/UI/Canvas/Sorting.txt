sorting of game objects inside of canvas,depends on render mode of canvas

for Screen Space based on hierarchy position of game objects:
                                children get rendered on top of parents
                                top children placed behind of bottom children (bottom children rendered on top of top children)

for World Space just like sprites, they sorted based on sorting layers and order in layer and not hierarchy posiitons
