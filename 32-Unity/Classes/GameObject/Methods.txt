AddComponent:
                AddComponent will create new instance of component and add it to game object and return new instance

                with AddComponent we can only add unity types (monobehaviour subclass components and built in component)
                we can't add custom class extend built in classes because they are not unity engine types

            calls method with given methodName on every monobehaviour component on this game object


            *** disabled component will receive message but not those with game objects with activeInHierarchy set to false
                simply put, only game objects with activeInHierarchy set to true component receive message just like awake

Get GameObjects Components 

    GetComponent -> search for component in gameobject (gameobject can be either active or inactive)

    GetComponentInParent -> search for component in gameobject first,then if not found, search in all ancestors

    GetComponentInChildren-> search for component in gameobject first,then if not found, search in all descendants

    Tips
    GetComponentIn Children and Parent only components on active GameObjects (activeInHierarchy) are matched unless explicitly specified.
    but GetComponent works on inactive game object too

    for GetComponentInChildren if game object itself activeInHierarchy set to false,it only search for component in game object itself and if found,return result and if not, return null and doesn't search through children
    but if gameobject activeInHierarchy set to true and no result found in itself,search through all of its descendants with activeInHierarchy set to true

    for GetComponentInParent if game object itself activeInHierarchy set to false,only start search from closest ancestor with activeInHierarchy set to true
    if gameobject itself activeInHierarchy set to true,first search in itself,then if not found,go upward
