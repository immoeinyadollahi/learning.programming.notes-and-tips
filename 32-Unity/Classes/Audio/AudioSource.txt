Fields
        play on awake:
                      this field, acts like onEnable for audio source component to play clip
                      if scene loaded and audio source component is enabled and its game object activeInHirerarchy set to true (all parents are active include game object itself)
                      or if component tree is inactive and changes to active
                      each time onEnable called for this component,clip will be played (restarted)


Instance Methods
                1. Play
                        AudioSource will assume any Play call will have a new audio clip to play. (will restart)
                        ** If AudioSource.clip is set to the same clip that is playing then the clip will sound like it is re-started. (Incorrect Unity Docs)
                        
                        **if change clip while playing,new clip will be set and stop previous clip from playing

                        if the clip attached to audio source is playing,it will be canceled when calling Play method

                2. PlayOneShot
                                this method does not cancel clips that are already being played by AudioSource.PlayOneShot and AudioSource.Play.
                                Multiple clip can be played on one AudioSource using PlayOneShot simultaneously
                                
                Play vs PlayOneShot:
                                        Play will play or restart (if call again) the clip attached to audio source, while PlayOneShot play additional clip from audio source which uses same configuration of attached clip
                                        even if you change configurations, they will be applied on PlayOneShot clip even for playing ones
                                        also can't stop PlayOneShot clip once played(but we can mute audio source to mute those clips which is ideal)
                                        


Static Methods
                1. PlayClipAtPoint
                        create new empty game object in the scene in  specified position and add a audio source component with given clip
                        then plays the clip and once the clip has finished playing, will destroy its game object
                        
                        ** it needs position hence its a 3D source
	
	
	                        Limitations
					we can't Adjust properties of AudioSource created with PlayClipAtPoint or access its game object
					PlayClipAtPoint creates a temporary game object called "One shot audio" that contains the AudioSource, and destroy it when the sound finishes. 
					Unfortunately, it doesn't give us any reference to the object created - shame on you, Unity: PlayClipAtPoint should return a reference to the AudioSource, or at least to the object created!
					
					so its better to write your own method for this to access game object or audio source create for temp sound
