these methods rotate and translate game objects relative to current rotation and position values
so we call them relative methods not absolute


if change transform.position relative to current position, then it is exactly the same as Translate with Space.World




Rotate
rotating with Rotate method (Self or World) and 
directly change transform properties
all produce different result

** this method rotates either in eularAngles or angle axis representation of quaternion


Translate
Transform.Translate (Space.Self) is same as transform.position=transform.TransformPoint(translation) (but not affected by scale)     or   transform.position+= transform.TransformDirection(translation)
Transform.Translate (Space.World) is same as transform.position += translation
