transform.root:

                if transform is root itself (doesn't have any parent which is game object) return self
                otherwise return root ancestor for this transform

transform.up/right/forward:

                transform.up/right/forward is Vector3.up/right/forward * transform.rotation
                means world axes but with considiring game object rotation

                ** these properties is based on global axes

                ** these properties are always normalized

                UP
                    transform up axis is world axis while considiring game object global rotation
                    we simple say, up direction of local(self) axes 

                    represents The Y axis (green axis) of the game object transform relative to world space

            
                Property Set
                setting these properties only rotate transform to put up or right or forward axis (self axis) in same direction as given direction vector
                *** given vector value treated as direction, so magniatude or position is not important and vector will be stored as normalized version

                same as TransformDirection(Vector3.up/right/forward)
