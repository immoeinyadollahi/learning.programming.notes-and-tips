two ways to set parent:

1. setting parent property
   this may change local transform but keep the global transform the same.

2. SetParent method
   if worldPositionStays parameter is true (default), its excatly same as setting parent property
   but if is false, local transform of game object remain unchanged but global may change.


** `may change` because if global transform of parents are equal, local and world transform of child game object will be equal when changing parent

so concept is maintain local transform and change world transform or maintain world transform and change local transform
