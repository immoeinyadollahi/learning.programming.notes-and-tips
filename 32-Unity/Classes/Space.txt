Space.self means apply rotation factor and in Space.world means don't apply that factor when translate or rotate



Space.Self will be used with Rotate and Translate methods to rotate and translate game objects while considering their computed rotation (global rotation) state

Space.World will be used for same methods to rotate and translate game object but ignore current rotation state

** local or global tool handle rotation are same as Space.Self and Space.World with Rotate method



Space.World used for transforming objects relative to world coordinate system and Space.Self used for transforming objects relative to local (self) coordinate system (which may rotate because of rotation)
