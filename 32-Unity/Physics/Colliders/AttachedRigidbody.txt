Unity -> Colliders are automatically connected to the rigidbody attached to the same game object or attached to any parent game object.




if collider game object has rigidbody, collider attached rigidbody will be that rigidbody, otherwise it will be first ancestor rigidbody (first rigidbody in ancestors)
but if there is no rigidbody in tree,it will be null


************** Assumption ************
for ancestors type of attached rigidbody,game object still has static body in physic engine which differs from attached rigidbody

colliders offset is offset relative to their rigidbody position in physic world,
therefore attached rigidbody is not same as actual rigidbody for collider in physic engine if attached rigidbody is in ancestors
