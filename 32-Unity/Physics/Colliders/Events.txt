OnMouseXXX 
if colldier doesn't have attached rigidbody or attached rigidbody is collider game object rigidbody,then sent this event for collider game object scripts
if colldier has attached collider other than its game object rigidbody,then only send message to that attached rigidbody scripts whether or not received by any script

simply put, if doesn't have attached rigidbody,for current game object,otherwise for attachedRigidbody game object scripts


Pseudo Code
raycasthit hit
if ( hit.rigidbody != null )
      hit.rigidbody.gameObject.SendMessage("OnMouseDown");
  else
      hit.collider.SendMessage("OnMouseDown");
 }

hit.rigidbody is attachedRigidbody of hitted collider






OnCollisionXXX/TriggerXXX sent for both collider game object scripts and also attachedRigidbody game object if is different from collider game object rigidbody (for both collided objects)

1. if attachedRigidbody is null or is same as collider gameObject rigidbody then send event only for that game object 
2. if attachedRigidbody is any of ancestors,then sent event for both ancestor game object and also collider game object
