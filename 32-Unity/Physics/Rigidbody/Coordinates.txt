joints anchors,colliders offsets,things like center of mass,... coordinates are relative to body position and axes

just like unity local transform which is relative to parent transform, local coordinates for these things is relative to bodies position and own axes which may rotated by their rotation


Rotation
only bodies in physics engine rotates
colliders can't rotate
