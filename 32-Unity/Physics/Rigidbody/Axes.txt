AddForce and AddTorque are based on global axes (without considiring rigidbody rotation) just like transform.Translate with Space.World

AddRelativeForce and AddRelativeTorque are same above methods except they are based on rigidbody axes or with considiring rigidbody rotation


rigidbody velocity is based on global axes

gravity force always applied on world axes and down direction,not rigidbody down direction in own awes
