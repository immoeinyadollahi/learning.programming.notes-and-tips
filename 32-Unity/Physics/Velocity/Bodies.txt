velocity can be applied on both dynamic and kinematic type body (not static)


Kinematic
for kinematic type,velocity will be applied as well

e.g. if type is dynamic and object falling by gravity and change type to kinematic,velocity will be preserved and applied in kinematic type as well

its not true gravity adds velocity to kinematic body, because kinematic body is unaffected by physic stuff except velocity


kinematic type may ignore physic stuff like collisions,forces(gravity),joints but velocity on body will be applied for kinematic type as well


the only physic applied to kinematic type is velocity (not position and rotation)



**************** Important ****************** 
A Kinematic Rigidbody 2D does still move via its velocity, but the velocity is not affected by forces or gravity.
means its constant unless changed explicitly







Static
when setting type to static,velocity will be set to zero

and if type is static and set velocity,will be ignored

velocity doesn't affect (apply) on static body
