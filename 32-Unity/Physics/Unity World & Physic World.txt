Transform
	unity will sync between its world transform data and physics world transform by interchange data between them
	whenever unity game objects transform changes, in right time unity query and update physic world corresponding bodies
	whenever physic simulation complete,unity update all game objects transform based on their bodies transform in physic world


Parenting System
		
    parenting system is part of unity world so there is no local transform or transform relative to parent in physics world and all world bodies are unrelated to each other
    each child of game objects is a different body and has its own global transform and there is no local transform in physic world

    when game object transform changes, game object itself and all of its children must recalcualte their transform and set changed flag for next physics cycle
    then in physics world transforms of all bodies get updated

    so there is no parenting or relationship between bodies, only colliders have relationship with their bodies

    Unless there are joints attaching them, the parent-child relation has no effect between rigidbodies in the same tree
    so there is not local transform in physic engine, only world transform, Unity however update parent-child transform in physic engine to sync with unity world


    e.g. when collison happens on a body,unity gets new transform from that body and apply that to corresponding game object transform,and then recalcualted children transform and i don't know may add changed flag for physics to get updated before next simulation or ...
