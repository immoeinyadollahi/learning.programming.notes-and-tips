After Simulation

    Updating transforms and other properties
    
    transform and other rigidbodies properties get updated after each simulation
    not once for multiple cycle updates because we need new physics information in each cycle in places like OnCollisionXXX or FixedUpdate,..,so they must be updated after each simulation
