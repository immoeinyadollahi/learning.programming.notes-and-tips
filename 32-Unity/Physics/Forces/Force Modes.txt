ForceMode.Force - Applies a gradual (continuous) force on the Object (in multiple steps), taking mass into account. This is a literal pushing motion where the bigger the mass of the Object, the slower it will speed up. 
ForceMode.Impulse - Applies an instant force on the Object, taking mass into account. This pushes the Object using the entire force in a single physic step. Again, the bigger the mass of the Object, the less effect this will have. Great for recoil or jump functions.

ForceMode.Acceleration - Same as ForceMode.Force except that it doesn't take mass into account. No matter how big the mass of the object, it will accelerate at a constant rate. (Only 3D)
ForceMode.VelocityChange - Same as ForceMode.Impulse and again, doesn't take mass into account. It will literally add the force to the Object's velocity in a single physic step. (Only 3D)


** last two methods only take mass into account,that is
