Force Position

*** if force applied directly on center of mass, it only generate linear velocity not angular
*** AddForce is same as AddForceAtPosiiton but applied diectly on center of mass


How To
for adding forces, we only need one vector,
which vector direction will be used as force direction and 
vector magnitude for force power,
so we don't need force extra parameter (like force power ,...)



Rules
        Body Type
                    when body type is kinematic or static using AddForce or other force methods will be ignored and no force will set on body
