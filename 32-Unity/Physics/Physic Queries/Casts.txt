casts only return one hit per each collider (may hit with multiple different collider if use `all` methods),for getting all hit for one collider you must cast multiple times
RayCastHit only contains one contact point of cast with each collider unlike Collision which return all contact points

even in raycast `all` method, only stores one hit (first hit) per collider and ignore further hits from that colliders

cast `all` means all different colliders (one hit per collider) not multiple hit for each collider
		
by default for cast methods only first collider hit will be returned
but with `all` method we can tell unity to get all hited colliders (not multiple hit per collider) (instruct physics engine to don't stop on first collider hit)

Tips

	1. casts will not detect Colliders for which the cast origin is inside the Collider (unless in 2d physics settings,set Queries Start In Colliders option to checked which default is checked)
	
	2. Raycast hit is not only for raycast,it will be used for all casts queries
	
	3. we don't need magnitude of direction of casts which is vector,only direction is important and we can handle length of casts by maxDistance parameter

	4. if no hit detected,return value will not be null and will be raycasthit object but its collider set to null which says no collider hitted
