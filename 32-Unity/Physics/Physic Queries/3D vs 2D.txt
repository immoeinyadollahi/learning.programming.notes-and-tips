Single query methods means find first query result and stop


Physic2D
all single query (casts or overlap) methods return object (collider or hit) and not bool
and don' need paramter hit as ref


Physic3D
overlap
    there is no single result overlap method
    all of them return all overlapped colliders

casts
    single query methods always return bool and can get hit info by passing hit variable as reference (out)
    casts can be all or single mode just like 2d


Ray Parameter Method
in physic 3d we can pass Ray object to raycast method, but in 2d we don't have this parameter overload
instead there is separate method called GetRayIntersection which does same thing
