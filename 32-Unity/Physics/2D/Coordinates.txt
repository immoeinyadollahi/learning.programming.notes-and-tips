unity only set X and Y fields for position of rigidbodies not Z (rb.position is vector2)
and after simulation unity get each rigidbody positions which are vector2
and updates only X and Y fields of transform.position and leave Z as previous value


so 2 colliders in unity world with different Z values still will collide with each other because physic engine is 2d, only X and Y passed to physic engine which makes collision happens
but unity only update X and Y after collision and doesn't change Z value
