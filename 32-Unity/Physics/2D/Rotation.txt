in 2d physic we only one axis rotation which is z-axis
other axes rotation will be ignored in 2d

unlike 3d rigidbody which use complete quaternion for rotation

methods for rotation in rigidbody 2d either receive angle which is z-axis rotation angle or z-axis extracted from quaternion

**** if we pass Quaterinon to SetRotation/MoveRotation methods, instead of full 3D rotation,only the z-axis rotation will be extracted.



Transform
X axis rotation will change height of collider components (x extent)
Y axis rotation will change width of collider components (Y extent)


*** rotation value like eulerAngles is always positive and in range of 0,360 degrees 
    if you set rotation to negative or more than 360 degrees, it will be corrected
