in unity by default,game object become static body in physx engine means every game object in scene become body (default is static body) and add to physics engine


Types





Tips
 1. when we add rigidbody component to it,for box2d it will become dynamic body and for physx it will become non-kinematic dynamic body 
    when setting is kinematic to checked,for box2d body type will be changed to kinematic and for physx Kinematic flag will be set on actor

 2. physic engine bodies created only for game objects because positions and rotations synced with game object transform
    it doesn't means bodies created for every game object
    unity only create physic engine body for game objects if there is any collider (any type) or rigidbody component,
    therefore for UI, it doesn't add any body in physic engine, because they don't usually have any collider or rigidbody
