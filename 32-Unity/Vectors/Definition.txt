Vectors are a fundamental mathematical concept which allow you to describe a direction and magnitude (length)

Concluded Definition

Vectors are lines (better to say Hypothetical lines) created by two points,start and end point
direction of line created by two points relative to coordinate axes called vector direction
distance of two points or line length called vector magniatude/length

** vectors essentialy are not lines or at least not real lines
   two points in coordinate system shapes a hypothetical line which have both direction and magniatude

** The magnitude, or length, of a vector, cannot be negative; it can be either be zero or positive.


vectors are often used to describe some of the fundamental properties such as the position of objects, the speed something is moving, or the distance between two objects


Use Cases
1. describe width (x) and height (y) (size)
2. coordinates
3. direction
4. magnitude




in unity all vectors start from world origin (0,0,0) and end with specified coordinates
so we don't need to specify start point of vectors
so coordinates of end point of vector, indicates which direction or what magnitude vector has





************** Important ******************
vectors can be used as actual vectors for direction,magnitude,coordinates,... or can be used for holding x,y,z values
some places like sprite render, use size field as vector not becasue of actual vector but for holding x,y values

in some places we use vectors only for direction (direction vector) and in some other places we use vectors for position (position vector)







Vectors in different spaces or coordinate systems
in world space,1 vector unit refers to 1 unity unit which is 1 meter
in screen space,1 vector unit refers to 1 pixel of screen

** vector unit differs from vector magnitude
