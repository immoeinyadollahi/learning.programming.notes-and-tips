Terminology
normalize means make thing normal,if its less or more than regular/usual state,make it normal (regular/usual) (not more, not less)


in Vectors,we may normalize magnitude of vector

the normal magnitude of vectors is 1

normalizing vectors means keep vector in same direction but by reducing/increasing xyz components units of vector, reduce/increase magnitude of vector to 1 while keeping direction of original vector

normalizing will clamp vector components between -1,1






Hint
    1. vector3 consists of XYZ components but vector2 only uses XY components (because world is always 3d, vector2 is vector3 with z component of 0)
    
    so if vector3 has z component with non-zero value and converted to vector2,both direction and magnitude will be different (z will be treated as 0)
    hence normalized version of vector3 will be different than normalized version of vector2 with same XY components






    2. when normalizing vector3 with 0,0,0 or vector2 with 0,0 values,values remain unchanged and magnitude will be 0
