we have two separate execution flow in unity:
1. editor
2. runtime (playing game  (play mode or build))


each of them have different lifecycle event functions and execution loop


unity execute c# code in both editor and runtime
objects (game objects,components,..) will be created in both environments
but their functionalities may be different

** serialzied version of scenes,game objects,components,... will be used in both environments

** things like project settings and preferences and ... can be used in both environments
   and things like Input,SceneManager,... are only for runtime and somethings are only for editor
