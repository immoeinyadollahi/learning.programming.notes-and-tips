unity in edit mode will still create instance of game objects and add instance of different components to it and we can also change their fields 
so in runtime,same objects fields and states will be used (new instance but with same states)


all objects and fields and also all configurations and assets and ... will be serialized into files which can be used later in both editor and specifically runtime
