first before rendering each frame and also before event methods like update and onGUI
unity first set Input state by comparing previous frame stored input state with new input state getting from device in this frame
input state means keydowns,holding keys,released keys 



update method which will be called once per frame (before rendering frame) can get proper input values
e.g. when getting input.getKeyDown, it ensures that only once when pressing keys, keydown happens and not more than once means in next frame it will be false and reset

onGUI method which will be called multiple times before each frame, getting input here may be undesired
e.g. getting input.getKeyDown may be true for many times onGUI get called before each frame





onEnabled will be called if component was disabled and get enabled or game object of this component get activated from inactive state or is active in first frame
