when adding new component dynamiclly to a game object or instantiating new game object in the scene,components Update or Start or Awake methods (or others like FixedUpdate ,... not onEnable which called when new instatnce created) 
get called after finishing current game frame and in start of next frame
so for new components they should wait until next frame begin

therefore new game objects components (or game objects which activated for first time) or new components added to game object will be synced with game lifecycle flow
Start and Awake and other lifecycle messages only get called for those new components,further messages will be synced or merged with previously exist game objects components
