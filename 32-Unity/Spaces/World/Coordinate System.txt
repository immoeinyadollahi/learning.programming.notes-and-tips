in unity world space we only have one coordinate system which is based on world transform
so if we use the term of local axes or self axes for game objects,it doesn't mean each game object has its own axes which may rotate.
local (not local space) or self axes means if want to translate or rotate or scale game object,we should consider game object rotation
(rotation and translate can ignore game object transform rotation state but scale can't)


when unity in docs says "Applies transformation relative to the world/local coordinate system." it means apply rotation factor when transforming game objects
not separate axes for game objects
