unity world is always 3d,even in 2d mode,world still remain 3d but somehow ignoring z axis (not really ignoring,treating z as 0) (camera orthographic projection mode and ...)

all transform calculations are based on 3d space (position,rotation,scale)
so every vector2 must be converted to vector3 for transform calculation

in most cases engine uses vector3, but in places like texture coordinates in a Mesh or texture offsets in Material or in physics2d uses vector2
