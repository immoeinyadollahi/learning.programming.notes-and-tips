in multiplayer (local or online)
each player game is separate from each other
each one belongs to differnt application
there for each one belongs to their own scenes
other players are just regular game objects in current player scene (don't have components like audio listener)

so for example audio listener for all of them belongs to their own scene and only one audio listener must exists for each one
but players transforms and components data will be synced with all players even played audio source
