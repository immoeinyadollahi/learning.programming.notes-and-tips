we have two types of projections:
orthographic
prespective

** for changing projection we only have one property which orthographic boolean field
   if set to true means orthographic projection, otherwise means prespective

** we usually use prespective for 3d view and orthographic for 2d



camera viewing volume defined by FOV for prespective projection and size (orthographic size) for orthographic projection
