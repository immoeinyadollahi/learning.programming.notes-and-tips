unity doesn't save any game data at runtime and they should be saved manually with saving solutions
and loaded again into memory when game starts just like how unity load serialized data

e.g. projects settings and runtime objects modifications will not be saved unless we save them manually


think we have a scene with a player,if in runtime we change player data (transform,...) it must be saved manually
and loaded again each time starting the game


so when starting the game,first unity load serialized data previously modified in editor (objects with their references and configurations and ...) into memory
then if we have saved any game data by any saving solution,we load them manually (may or may not override unity data loaded first)
then show actual game to player
