Process
1. check if field serialized or not if debug mode enabled
2. field doesn't have HideInInspacetor attribute



Rules
1.  The Inspector window only shows the value of the serialized fields of the inspected objects.
    but doesn't mean every serialized field must show in inspector (HideInInspector)
    
2. unity only show public methods (instance or static) in inspector fields that need methods
   methods don't get serialized but only their names with corresponding component will be stored
   HideInInspacetor or SerializeField doesn't affect methods
   
   *** if method accept parameters,only those method with specific types of parameters will be shown in inspector
