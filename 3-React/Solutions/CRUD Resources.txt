you can fetch whole resource after update or create or delete one of them (good for shopping cart and other server dependent calculations)
you can do crud one specific item,then using map/filter/concat method to add/delete/update that item and leave other ones like before (not good for shopping cart and other server dependent calculations)


for only update: you can use interal state for each item,then after update only change that state (be aware that list of items will not be changed (original items list))
