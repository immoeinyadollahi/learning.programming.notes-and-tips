regex methods: test,exec

str methods : match,matchAll,search,replace,replaceAll,split



If you need to know if a string matches a regular expression RegExp, use RegExp.test().

If you only want the first match found, you might want to use RegExp.exec() instead.

If you want to obtain capture groups and the global flag is set, you need to use RegExp.exec() or String.prototype.matchAll() instead.



match:

without global flag returns first match found with all capturing groups and index info

with global flag only returns all match without any capturing groups and index info


split:

it is always globaly even with non-global regex


match vs exec
if you dont want to global search and find all matches they are exactly the same with same results but 
with global search exec works better and more appropriate
