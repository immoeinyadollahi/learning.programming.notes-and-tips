This property is set only if the regular expression instance used the g flag to indicate a global search, or the y flag to indicate a sticky search.
 The following rules apply when test() and exec() are called on a given input:

If lastIndex is greater than the length of the input (means that void after string also included as part of length of string), exec() or test() will not find a match, and lastIndex will be set to 0.
If lastIndex is equal to or less than the length of the input, exec() or test() will attempt to match the input starting from lastIndex.:

		If exec() or test() find a match, then lastIndex will be set to the position of the end of the matched string in the input. (lastIndex will be incremented by match length)
		If exec() or test() do not find a match, then lastIndex will be set to 0.




lastIndex is g flag or y flag complementary to achieve to this flags goal.
g flag use lastIndex to start next match from this position until end 
y flag use lastIndex to matches exact position of lastIndex

lastIndex or general index equals to length of string means void after string
