all classes are expression and there exp value are pure function that generated from constructor

class with constructor

if class extends a parent class,first should call super
super is equal to parent.call(this,args)
we dont need its result,just for modify this keyword

class without constructor
if class doesn't extend from parent class then constructor is a empty function or only public field setting
otherwise constructor is something like this:
constructor(){
super.apply(this, arguments)

public field settings

}



the generated constructor is if class exp value that is a function,therefore result is a function
