we have two main things:
1. global object (window or global (for node))
2. global scope

assumptions
1.when assigning property or method to global object they also will be declared for global scope immediately
2.instead when accessing variables or method,interpreter first search through upper scopes,then global scope, finally if variable not found,search through global object


Node js
its not possible to control global scope (declaring variable for global scope) in node because all modules wrapped by wrapper function,it only means developer can't declare variable for global scope but node internally can
`var something` inside a Node.js module will be local to that module
instead we can assign property or method to global object

Browser
we can declare variable in global scope unlike node

when declaring variable with var or declaring function or class statement (declarations ) in global scope,variable  automatically become property and functions become method of window object
but not variables with let and const keyword (can become variables of global scope however if declared in global scope) however we can add property to window manually


global scope
this scope will be create when main execution context executed
