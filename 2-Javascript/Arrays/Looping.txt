methods like forEach,map,... loop from 0 until array length (exclusive) and only call callback if current index is own property of array (must exists) otherwise continue to next index
therefore for array with empty slots only iterate over array elements that is not empty (not undefined but only own property)

all callback dependent method

member access and dynamic member access however return undefined for given index but given index is not exists at all

but fill method fills empty slots as well for given range
