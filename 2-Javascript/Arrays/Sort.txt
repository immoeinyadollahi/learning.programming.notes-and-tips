Since version 10 (or EcmaScript 2019), sort method is stable. means items that have the same sort field,
will remain in the same order as before calling the sort. This is what a stable sorting algorithm guarantees.(keep original order of a and b)

but in mongodb or prior versions of javascript order of items with same sort field were not stable (random)
in sql, rows with same value of orderby column , by default keep there original order,you can specify another column to change there order
