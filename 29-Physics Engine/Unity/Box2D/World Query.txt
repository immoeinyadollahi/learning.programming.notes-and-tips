in box 2d we only have raycast that we can add custom callback to filter fixtures based on category bits and mask bits
an there is no other casting features as well as any overlap methods (no overlapXXX,overlapXXXAll,boxCast,capsulecast,...)
unlike physx which has all methods available
so this methods added by unity
