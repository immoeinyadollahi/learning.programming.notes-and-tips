we have three types of scene queries
1. raycast
2. sweep (geometrically similar to a raycast() or geometric raycast (same for boxcast,capsulecast in unity))
3. overlap (searches a region enclosed by a specified shape for any overlapping shapes in the scene)
			return only shapes (collider)
			
			
			
			
we have three Query modes which can be applied on each query
1. closest hit
2. any hit
3. multiple hit

for unity closest hit is for methods without `all` name (casts and overlap)
cast methods with `all` name, change the mode of query based on that 

** all overlap methods in 3d will get all results not first one
