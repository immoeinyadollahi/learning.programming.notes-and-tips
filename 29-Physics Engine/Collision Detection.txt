collision detection works by checking coordinates, if two object has cross point or coordinates, they actually collided with each other

collisions will be detected when two colliders collided with each other
even if three or more colliders collide with each other at same time, they will be treated (divided) as pairs
so collision works on pair colliders and events dispatched for every pair
