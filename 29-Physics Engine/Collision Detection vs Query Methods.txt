collision is used for detecting colliders collision in simulation time
queries (overlap or cast) will be used for detecting colliders in specific area and casting used for detecting hit by casting virtual object

short:
collisions are part of simulation time (happen at simulation time)
overlap and casting are part of querying (happen outside of simulation)
