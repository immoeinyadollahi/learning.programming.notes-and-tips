we can only change bodies global position
we don't have any local position for bodies in physics world
but for colliders we can only set their local position relative to parent

e.g. in physx we only have setGlobalPose for bodies but for colliders because each collider has transform relative to body, there is setLocalPos which set collider position relative to its actor (body)
we can change global position of colliders and only can set realtive position of them



physics engine only support local transform for colliders
