all logical operators returns 1 or 0 (true and false)


also we have some extra operators for some of these operators that are aliases for these operators :

NOT BETWEEN

NOT EXISTS

NOT IN

NOT LIKE

for example --- id NOT IN (1,2,...) --- is equivalent to    NOT (id IN (1,2,...))
another example is --- 1 != 2 --- that is equivalent to     !(1=2)






SOME,EXISTS,ANY,ALL only accept subquery but IN accept both subquery and regular list
