when content get bigger than element,overflow happens on element

overflow like background starts from start of padding


an element with overflow property must have fixed-length width\height otherwise not working


overflow has two steps:

overflow-x initialization starts from end of left-padding (right-padding in ltr) and its applyment starts from start of that padding
 
overflow-y initialization starts from end of bottom-padding and its applyment starts from start of that padding 



if one of overflow (x or y) set to hidden, another one will be hidden as well
