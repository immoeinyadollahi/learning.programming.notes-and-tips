if position property doesn't exists or set to all except absolute and fixed
	in this case an anchor (fake position (top/left/bottom/right)) will be applied to element relative to parent but after padding and element will be realigned after width/height changes on every dom render

	height always anchored to top but will be anchored to bottom in column-reverse flex-direction of parent
	width in rtl always anchored to left and in ltr anchored to right , and inverse in row-reverse flex-direction of parent

if position is set to absolute or fixed and width/height property exists
	if both top/bottom exists,top will be accepted (bottom property will be ignored at all even in positioning like when doesn't exists,changes to it doesn't change anything)
	if both left/right exists,left will be accepted (right property will be ignored at all even in positioning like when doesn't exists,changes to it doesn't change anything)
	
	if element doesn't have width/height property both left/right or top/bottom will be affected
	
	
there is no growing concept or grow direction its a visual illusion by browser because its very fast at rendering
every visual element are positioned by pixel ,so its like always absolute position in screen so we need to realign element in every render


examples:

for resize element (not positioned element) we should calculate resized distance and move away element from its anchor by resize distance
