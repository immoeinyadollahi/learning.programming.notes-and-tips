variable declration order is not important,
this means you can use variable in a selector before declare it (in bottom selector)

variables works like js scopes,means only selected element and its descendants can use it in their selectors,
children selectors variable declration override their ancestors selectors veriable declration if veriable name exists in ancestors selectors just like javascirpt

its not based on selectors, instead its based on elements hirarchy in dom tree
