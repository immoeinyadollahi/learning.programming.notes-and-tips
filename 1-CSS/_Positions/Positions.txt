Relative:
	an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document(means other elements dont take its place after positioning)
	But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work.
	The positional properties move the element from the original position in that direction.
	The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,
 	and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top,
	right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements;
Sticky: 
	The sticky value is like a compromise between the relative and fixed values,
	it allows you to position an element relative to anything on the document and then, once a user has scrolled past a certain point in the viewport,
	fix the position of the element to that location so it remains persistently displayed like an element with a fixed value
	the element is treated like a relative value until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold,
	at which point the element takes a fixed position where it is told to stick.

	treshold of sticky elements are end of its parent

Absolute:
 	the element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it’s not even there(means other elements take its last place) whilst all the other positional properties will work on it.
	absolute positioned elements are relative to closest positioned ancetor or if there is no one then relative to root element of document

Fixed:
	the element is removed from the flow of the document like absolutely positioned elements.
	fixed positioned elements are relative to viewport or window
