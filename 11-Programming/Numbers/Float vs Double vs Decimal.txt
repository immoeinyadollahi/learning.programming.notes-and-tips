The Decimal, Double, and Float variable types all are floating point number (اعشاری) but are different in the way that they store the values. Precision is the main difference where 
float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type,
double is a double precision (64 bit) floating point data type 
and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type.
