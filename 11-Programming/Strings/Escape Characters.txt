three type of escape character:
1-universal escape character like  \n\t\r
2-regex
3-programming languages



escape characters are characters that cause to (used for)  special behavior in different areas



in regex:

used in two ways:

for characters that are usually treated literally ,indicates that the next character is special and not to be interpreted literally

for characters that are usually treated specially, indicates that the next character is not special and should be interpreted literally.


but:

some characters like @ neither have a special meaning when escaped nor when unescaped so  \@ or @ are equivalent (always literal)






considerations:

in  \\x   second back slash loses its ability to escape its next character
