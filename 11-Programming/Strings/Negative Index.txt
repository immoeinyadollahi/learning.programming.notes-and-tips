indexes are always zero or positive integers.

negative indexes available in :

1-php string index
2-substr,slice (array or string)


this are tricks.there is no negative indexes at all

"asads"[-2] ->>>>  str[str.length-2] --->>> subtraction of length with abs of negative index  or  sum of length with negative index

substr,slice convert negative values to positive value with above trick
